** Database setup
We're using supabase postgres and sort of reliant on its auth database setup. So if we're testing we'd want to replicate some of it.
*** Test DB Setup
#+begin_src sql
CREATE DATABASE sia_test_db WITH OWNER postgres;

\c sia_test_db

CREATE SCHEMA auth AUTHORIZATION postgres;

-- NOTE: This is a very trimmed down version
-- N
CREATE TABLE auth.users (
    instance_id uuid,
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email TEXT
);

-- Now we've minimally replicated supabase postgres in our local system, so we're good for running tests. At this point we can run our application migration scripts as per our need.
#+end_src
